**MQTT X.509 Certificate Chain Authentication** uses client-side TLS certificates to authenticate MQTT clients. 
During the TLS handshake, the client presents its certificate, which the broker validates against a trusted certificate authority (CA) or a configured certificate chain.
This method provides strong security by relying on public key infrastructure (PKI) and is well-suited for environments where devices can securely store and manage private keys and certificates. 
It eliminates the need for passwords and reduces the risk of credential leakage.

### Authentication

#### Credentials Matching

The "X.509 Certificate Chain" credentials have a **"Use certificate CN regex"** option that controls how credentials are matched.

* When "Use certificate CN regex" is disabled:
the "Certificate common name (CN)" must **exactly** match the CN of the client's certificate or, if present, one of the parent's certificates in the chain. 
Authentication will fail if none of the certificates have an exactly matching CN.

* "Use certificate CN regex" is enabled:
the "Certificate common name (CN) matcher regex" must match the CN of the client's certificate or, if present, one of the parent's certificates in the chain. 
Authentication will fail if no certificate in the chain matches the regex.

#### Credentials ID

The generation of `credentialsId` is done as follows:

- credentialsId = `ssl|$CERTIFICATE_COMMON_NAME`;
- credentialsId = `ssl|$CERTIFICATE_COMMON_NAME_REGEX`.

Where `$CERTIFICATE_COMMON_NAME` is the common name of the certificate from the chain, `$CERTIFICATE_COMMON_NAME_REGEX` is a regex-based string
that should be matched with the certificate's CN from the chain.

### Authorization

After the user has been authenticated, it is possible to restrict the client's access to topics they can publish or subscribe to.

To provide flexible control over authorization rules, TBMQ uses regular expressions. 

For example, to **allow clients to publish or subscribe to all topics** that begin with **city/**, an authorization rule should be created with the value **city/.***.

For TLS type, authorization is configured using the **authRulesMapping** field of the corresponding MQTT Client Credentials.
Here is a model of the credentials value:

```
{
    "certCnPattern": $certCnPattern,
    "certCnIsRegex": $certCnIsRegex,
    "authRulesMapping": $authRulesMapping
}
```
{: .copy-code}

Where:
- $certCnPattern - the pattern for the common name that should be present in the certificate chain.
- $certCnIsRegex - option to control whether the common name (CN) pattern is treated as a regular expression (regex) for matching.
- $authRulesMapping - the mapping used to configure the access restrictions for different keywords.
  For example,
  ```
  {
      "example_1": {
	      "pubAuthRulePatterns": ["example_pub_topic/.*"],
	      "subAuthRulePatterns": ["example_sub_topic/.*"]
	  },
	  "example_2": {
          "pubAuthRulePatterns": [".*"],
		  "subAuthRulePatterns": [".*"]
      }
  }
  ```
  {: .copy-code}

This allows clients to connect with a certificate containing **example_1** in its CN to publish only to topics that start with **example_pub_topic/** and 
subscribe to topics that start with **example_sub_topic/**. Clients with a certificate containing **example_2** are allowed to publish and subscribe to any topic.

**Note:** if either **pubAuthRulePatterns** or **subAuthRulePatterns** is set to `null` or an empty list (`[]`), the client will not be able to publish to or subscribe to any topics.
